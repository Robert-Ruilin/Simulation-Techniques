Project 1: Linear Congruential Generator
Design a random number generator on the interval U(0,1)
Show using statistical tests that it generates effective pseudo random numbers in terms of their distribution and their independence.

Project 2: Exotic Option Pricing
Build an excel spreadsheet (you may use other languages if you wish but the code you have written must be visible) to perform Monte Carlo calculations of the following options:
1. European call and put options with Poisson jump processes
2. European exotic options including barrier, digital and look-back options
3. American put options
